      <div class="bg-stone-400 x-divider mb-2" />
      <span class="text-md font-light">
        As we get started, our program is targeting the secondary youth in central Indiana ages 14-18. Students will come to the program either through participation in one of our summer camps or during the school year by applying and interviewing for enrollment.  Once entering the program, our students are asked to make a one year commitment and all students will be encouraged to remain in the program through high school graduation.

      <span class="text-md font-light">
        We support youth in taking responsibility from the beginning of our program as they build foundational skills in barn management and horse care needed to participate in equine activities and sport.  TtR youth will apply their learning to set goals and work a plan for reaching their goals.  The ultimate goal is that youth, staff, and of course, their horses- everyone will learn together and see the incredible rewards of goal setting and hard work.

      <span class="text-md font-light">
        TtR youth are encouraged to choose the disciplines that interest them as they develop and grow in their abilities.  They are exposed to a variety of equine sports, competitions and activities. At the same time, as youth develop and grow they are given opportunities to serve as teacher, coach and mentor to new and younger students. Excelling in the equestrian world creates a true sense of personal challenge and growth as an individual.  It also creates the drive within to excel in school work.  Our staff and volunteers will be here to help with tutoring and study time after school as academic achievement is required to remain in the program.  Graduating from high school with a life and work plan are as necessary as achieving equine objectives.
