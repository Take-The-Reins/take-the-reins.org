					Take the Reins Youth Stable for Life is unique in central Indiana.  Other equine programs in our area may focus
					on a special target population, have minimal or basic youth and horse interaction, and may even run the program
					on a fee for service basis.  Typically a comprehensive equine program such as ours is seen as being only for
					people of means.  For the under-resourced and low income youth of central Indiana, Take the Reins is a free
					program. <TTRSignature /> youth are investing in their own lives to become productive citizens, and you are KEY
					to helping them fulfill their mission!
				</span>
				<span class="text-md font-light">
					There are many ways you can help us move forward with our mission.  You can volunteer in more ways than you can
					imagine! But for now, please consider supporting Take the Reins by donating to help us move through our three
					development Phases.
