      The founders and staff of Take the Reins have backgrounds in both education and business.  Our board of directors
      is committed to high performance standards.  From the start of our program, we will seek partnerships with schools
      and with university education departments to assess our staff  and studentâ€™s performance.

      We are results oriented and fully expect the program to be highly dynamic.  We are committed not only to reporting
      how our program is performing, but also in actively sharing and collaborating with other programs similar to ours,
      both in central Indiana as well as across the country.

      While we may be the first program of its type here in Indiana, we are modeling ourselves after highly successful
      programs in Philadelphia (the <a href="https://worktoride.net/" style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank">Work to Ride Stable at Chamounix Equestrian Center</a>)
      and Detroit (<a href="https://www.detroithorsepower.org/" style="text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank">Detroit Horse Power</a>).
      Both programs have been existence for years and are in the middle of major expansion and growth programs.
